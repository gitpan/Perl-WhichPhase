SYNOPSIS

     if(block eq 'BEGIN') {

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows determination of the phase the Perl compiler and
    interpreter are in, one of BEGIN, INIT, END, or CHECK, or "undef"ined if
    none of the four apply.

METHODS
    All of the functions listed here are importable. The import tag ":in"
    may be used to name all the functions beginning with "in_".

    block
        This will return one of the four strings BEGIN, INIT, END, or CHECK
        if Perl is current running that phase. If Perl is not running one of
        those phases, then this will return "undef".

    in_BEGIN
        This will return true of the code is being run in a BEGIN block.

    in_CHECK
        This will return true of the code is being run in a CHECK block.

    in_CODE
        This will return true if the code is not being run in any of the
        four phases.

    in_END
        This will return true of the code is being run in an END block.

    in_INIT
        This will return true of the code is being run in an INIT block.
